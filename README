termserv and its client demonstrate how ssh works. It's unencrypted etc., but
it's able to transmit a whole shell session over network, including vim, less,
htop etc.

It makes heavy use of pseudo terminals.

termserv uses libsocket (https://github.com/dermesser/libsocket). Please install it before
compiling termserv with the following commands:

	$ gcc -o srv -lsocket termserv.c
	$ gcc -o cl -lsocket client.c

What's also important: Adapt the IP in client.c to your environment!

Termserv sends the window size as `struct winsize` first so it may cause problems when running on
different architectures...

===>>>>> AND THIS IS REALLY, REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT: A RUNNING TERMSERV INSTANCE IS AN OPEN TELNET
SERVER WITH ACCESS TO THE FULL ACCOUNT AND SHELL OF THE OWNER OF THE SERVER!!!11! <<<<<<===
