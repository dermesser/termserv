termserv and its client demonstrate how ssh works. It's unencrypted etc., but
it's able to transmit a whole shell session over network, including vim, less,
htop etc.

It makes heavy use of pseudo terminals.

termserv uses libsocket (https://github.com/dermesser/libsocket). Please install it before
compiling termserv with the following commands:

	$ gcc -o srv -lsocket termserv.c
	$ gcc -o cl -lsocket client.c

What's also important: Adapt the IP in client.c to your environment!
